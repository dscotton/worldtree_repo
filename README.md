Worldtree is a 2d platform game written for the National Game Development Month
game jam in 2012.

Worldtree was written using pygame, which must be installed for it to work.

TODO: update to use pygame2, and set up reasonable dependency management (pip
install didn't work for pygame1 when I last checked.)
